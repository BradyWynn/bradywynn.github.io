  <h1>Arithmetic Coding with GPT</h1>
  <h2>background</h2>
  <p>
    Last summer Neuralink held a
    <a href="https://content.neuralink.com/compression-challenge/README.html"
      >compression challenge</a
    >
    where 200x lossless compression was needed to send electrode recordings
    wirelessly. This was
    <a href="https://x.com/felix_red_panda/status/1794027648257020292"
      >mocked</a
    >
    as being impossible but inspired a similar challenge from
    <a href="https://comma.ai/">comma.ai</a>, a company developing an open
    source autopilot. This blogpost explains my submission to the Comma
    challenge that is comparable to second place.
  </p>
  <h2>the challenge</h2>

  <p>
    The challenge is to "losslessly compress 5,000 minutes of driving data."
    5,000 minutes is also equivalent to 83 hours or 3 days of video. An example
    clip is shown below.
  </p>
  <br />
  <video width="700" controls class="img_responsive">
    <source
      src="attachment\249573591-91894bf7-592b-4204-b3f2-3e805984045c.mp4"
      ,
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
  <br />
  <p>
    The video is low resolution, just 256x128, but even at this low resolution
    the full 5,000 minutes of footage would be very large. So before providing
    the data Comma has already heavily compressed it using a
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00937">VQ-VAE</a> to make it easier to
    work with.
  </p>
  <img src="attachment\image2274.png" class="img_responsive" width="700" />
  <p>
    Using the VQ-VAE network the video is compressed from raw 256x128 frames to
    10 bit 16x8 frames. This intermediate frame is called the latent
    representation and it being 10 bit means its values can take on any integer
    from 0 to 1023. If we only store the latent representation and decoder we
    can recover the original image. Note however that this is lossy compression
    which means information is lost when compressing so the reconstructed image
    won't exactly match the original. Below is the same example video but now
    compressed with the VQ-VAE.
  </p>

    />
  </video>
  <br />
  <p>
    Storing the 5,000 minutes of driving data normally takes 915 MB and the
    first place submission has a compression ratio of 3.4 meaning they were able
    to compress the data into 270 MB.
  </p>
  <h2>arithmetic coding</h2>
  <p>
    Arithmetic coding is a popular lossless compression technique. Lossless
    compression means that no information is lost in the process and is
    different from lossy compression formats such as jpeg that lose quality when
    compressed. To begin, arithmetic coding first needs a model that assigns a
    probability to each character of how likely it is to appear. An example is
    shown below:
  </p>
  <br />
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Character</th>
      <th>Probability</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>a</th>
      <th>0.2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>b</th>
      <th>0.3</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>c</th>
      <th>0.5</th>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br />
  <p>
    We also need a message to compress and in this case we will use "bac". To
    begin encoding the message we split the range from 0 to 1 into three
    different parts corresponding to the characters, with each interval's width
    dependent on its probability. Since the model assigns the highest
    probability to "c", it has the largest interval, while "a" and "b" have
    smaller intervals. The first letter of the message is "b", so the message
    has to be contained within the interval from 0.2 to 0.5. Since we know that
    the message has to be in that interval we can again subdivide it according
    to our characters and their probabilities. The second letter is "a" so the
    message must be contained within the new "a" interval, and we then further
    subdivide it into the three parts. We continue like this until the message
    has been fully encoded. The final interval that our message falls in is from
    0.23 to 0.26 because, for every single point inside the interval, the first
    three letters of the message are "bac".
  </p>
  <img src="attachment\encode 2.png" class="img_responsive" , width="700" />
  <p>
    However, we haven't actually compressed the message yet. We now need to
    convert this range into a binary sequence that can be stored. To do this we
    will split the interval from 0 to 1 in half; if the interval of our message
    falls below 0.5 we record a 0, and if it falls above 0.5, we record a 1. For
    our example, since the interval 0.23 to 0.26 is below 0.5, we record a 0 and
    split the range from 0 to 0.5 in half. We repeat this until the binary
    sequence is entirely contained within the interval of 0.23 to 0.26. For the
    message "bac" the encoding is 001111.
  </p>

  <img src="attachment\binary.png" class="img_responsive" , width="700" />
  <p>
    To decode the encoded message, you simply do the reverse of the encoding.
    First, convert the binary 001111 to decimal to get 0.234375. Since this
    falls within the range of 0.2 to 0.5 the first letter is "b". This is
    repeated until the message is recovered. However, you also need an end
    condition, because you could continue decoding a message forever. You can
    either define a specific character in the vocabulary to be an
    end-of-sequence character or simply stop at a specific length.
  </p>
  <p>
    What was described above is called infinite precision arithmetic coding
    because it requires infinite precision. Computers do not have infinite
    precision and if you were to try and implement this it would fail for longer
    sequences because the intervals would become so tiny that the computer would
    not be able to represent them properly.

      >This</a
    >
    excellent blog post explains the finite precision version of the algorithm
    that works for longer sequences and that I used for my implementation.
  </p>
  <h2>transformers for arithmetic coding</h2>
  <p>
    As previously mentioned for arithmetic coding to work you need a model to
    provide probabilities for each symbol. Conveniently included in the
    repository with the driving data is a GPT-2 medium sized model (about 350
    million parameters) that is trained on 3 million minutes of driving data to
    predict the next token. What they did was flatten the 10-bit 16x8 latent
    representation into 128 "tokens" per frame and the model takes in past
    tokens as context and produces a probability distribution across all 1024
    possible values for the next token.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can use this model with arithmetic coding to compress the data, and while
    it works, there are two major problems. The first problem is that the model
    itself takes up 614 MB, so just storing it would take more than twice the
    space of the entire first place submission. The second problem is that
    because the model is so large, it is extremely slow. On my GPU (RTX 3070 Ti)
    it runs at 130 tokens per second which doesn't sound terrible, but since
    there are 768 million tokens (5,000 minutes * 1,200 frames per minute * 128
    tokens per frame) it would take 68 days to decode all of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an aside, this isn't actually a novel idea, and
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10668">this</a> paper proposed exactly
    this method but with language models and text compression instead of driving
    data.
  </p>
  <h2>baseline model</h2>
  <p>
    To get a better baseline we can train a similar model to the one Comma
    trained but with 100x less parameters. This should make it significantly
    faster and easier to work with. Below is just the loss for this model.
  </p>

  <img src="attachment/baseline.png" class="img_responsive" , width="700" />

  <p>
    Using the cross entropy loss from training the model we can estimate how
    well it will compress. In PyTorch cross entropy uses natural log, but if we
    convert it to base 2 we get that the model needs about 3.6 bits per symbol.
    Since each symbol normally takes 10 bits we can do 10/3.6 to get a
    compression ratio of 2.78. This is already better than the second place
    submission! It's not quite right though because we also need to store the
    model which is about 7 MB so the actual compression ratio will be closer to
    2.7.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though this model is 100x smaller, speed is still an issue. It now
    generates at 908 tokens per second which is an improvement, but it would
    still take 10 days to decompress all the data.
  </p>

  <h2>architecture improvements</h2>
  <p>
    We can always just continue to train smaller and smaller models until it is
    fast enough, but the performance drops as it gets smaller so it can't be too
    tiny. Let's take a moment and think about what the model is actually doing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently the model takes in some tokens as context, then outputs a
    probability distribution over all possible next tokens that gets passed to
    the arithmetic coder to compress the sequence. Since each frame of video is
    128 tokens this process repeats 128 times to compress a single frame and
    this constant switching between the model doing inference and the arithmetic
    coder compressing is not good for performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get around this problem you can make an independence assumption that
    tokens within a frame won't help predict other tokens within the same frame.
    The context can be restricted to just the previous frames. With this
    assumption, we can modify the transformer to instead produce probabilities
    for every single token in a frame at the same time. This is a great idea
    because it means the model is 128 times faster for free and it removes some
    of that back and forth between the model and arithmetic coder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another advantage of predicting on a frame level actually comes from an
    implementation detail with the original model. If you flatten and then feed
    multiple frames into the model it won't be able to tell where one begins and
    another ends. To fix this, an extra token is added to the vocabulary called
    the BOS, or "Beginning of Sequence" token, and it's used to separate frames.
    With this token each frame becomes 129 tokens instead of 128 which is now
    extra overhead when compressing. However, with the modified frame level
    transformer we can get rid of the BOS token completely and instead add
    another positional embedding for frame position.
  </p>

  <p>
    To check that this independence assumption is reasonable, we can compare the
    loss graphs of the old transformer that predicted on token level and the new
    frame level transformer. While this is not an exact apples to apples
    comparison because of the differing vocabulary sizes (1024 vs 1025), it
    should be close enough.
  </p>

  <img src="attachment\old_vs_new.png" class="img_responsive" , width="700" />

  <p>
    Both models eventually converge to about the same loss so this seems to
    validate the assumption. The great thing about this is that the new model
    can now generate at a blazingly 116,224 tokens per second and decode all
    5,000 minutes of driving data in 2 hours!
  </p>

  <h2>optimal model size</h2>
  <p>
    I arbitrarily chose the size of the baseline model to be 100x smaller than
    the Comma model but the number of parameters has a major impact on the
    eventual compression ratio. A larger model has a lower loss and can
    therefore compress better but the model itself takes up more space.
    Conversely a smaller model takes up less space but compresses worse. There
    is some optimal model size where the tradeoffs are balanced to achieve the
    maximum compression ratio.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get an idea of how model size impacts loss I trained many differently
    sized models to convergence. They're relatively small, the largest being
    only 9 million parameters but I am GPU poor and don't want to wait days for
    a training run.

  <p>
    Every model was trained with a batch size of 1,048,576 for 1 epoch where a
    single epoch is 13917 steps so about 14 billion tokens or 95,000 minutes of
    driving data. For most of the models this is much more training than needed
    and certainly more than the compute optimal amount. Every model also has a
    context length of 4096 tokens or 32 frames and I used Muon over AdamW for
    all the applicable parameters.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a log-log plot with the cross entropy train loss on the y-axis and
    compute measured in PetaFLOP-days on the x-axis. The larger models
    eventually cross the smaller models and the left edge of all the training
    runs trace out a compute-efficient frontier.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since we have many differently sized models and their loss we can use them
    to fit a power law as proposed in "<a
      href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361"
      >Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models</a
    >." Following their convention I am using non-embedding parameters and
    non-embedding compute. Below you can see the fitted power law on another
    log-log plot where the x-axis is parameter count and the y-axis is cross
    entropy train loss.
  </p>

  <img
    src="attachment/train_loss_vs_parameters.png"
    class="img_responsive"
    width="700"
  />

  <p>
    We can use this to approximate the loss for a model with N parameters, or
    say you need a certain loss L you can find how large the model would need to
    be. We can also use this function to plot the compression ratio against
    parameters.
  </p>

  <img src="attachment/Figure_2.png" class="img_responsive" width="700" />

  <p>
    This is not a log-log plot and it demonstrates how quickly the compression
    ratio tapers off. A model with a compression ratio equal to first place
    would need 33 million parameters but of course the model itself takes up
    space. We can factor this into the equation to get the final compression
    ratio equation.
  </p>

  <img src="attachment/Figure_3.png" class="img_responsive" width="700" />

  <p>
    Now instead of increasing forever the lines eventually peak at some maximum
    compression ratio and as the size of the model increases it begins to
    dominate the compression ratio and erase all savings from the lower loss.
    Each of the different lines represent different precisions for storing model
    parameters. For all my models I used 16 bit parameters but you can see
    reducing that to 8 or even 4 would likely improve the compression ratio
    (although model performance might degrade from lower precision).
  </p>
  <p>
    So we have a model that is close to the optimal model size but we're back to
    where we started because now it's too slow again. It is only able to get
    around 7,000 tokens per second which means it would take about 30 hours to
    decompress. Luckily there are a few inference optimizations we can implement
    to help!
  </p>

  <h2>kv caching and batching</h2>
  <p>
    One very common and easy performance gain is KV caching. Currently when
    doing a forward pass the model is computing the keys and values for every
    single token in the context, but this is pretty wasteful because the keys
    and values do not change for already seen tokens. Thus the idea of kv
    caching is to compute the keys and values for a token once and then store
    them to be reused. There is one problem and it's that since I used learned
    positional encodings in training I have to chunk sequences into context
    length sized blocks to use KV caching. At the beginning of each chunk the
    tokens will have no context so the predictions will be worse. On average
    this comes out to be about 1.6 bytes of overhead per minute or lowering the
    compression ratio by 0.08.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before KV caching the model was decoding at 7,000 tokens per second and
    after it jumped to about 18,000. This is a pretty nice improvement but we
    can keep going with improvements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently each minute of driving data is being compressed sequentially one
    after the other, but transformers can do batched inference. If we pass 32
    minutes of driving data to the model it can do a single forward pass
    generating probabilities for all of them in parallel. Batching alone takes
    the performance from 7,000 tokens per second to 10,000 tokens per second but
    we can actually combine KV caching and batching to increase the final speed
    to 70,000 tokens per second. This brings the final decoding time to 3 hours
    which is still pretty long but manageable.
  </p>

  <h2>fun visualizations</h2>
  <p>
    To end, I just wanted to show off some cool things we can do with the
    models. Originally all the sequences were stored with the same number of
    bits, but the arithmetic coding allows for different sequences to be
    compressed to different sizes. We can sort all the sequences according to
    their compressed sizes and see what the differences are. Below is the
    smallest minute of driving data and it is 27 KB. The clip is not very
    exciting and most of it is sitting still with nothing in the frame changing
    which makes sense since the fewer changes there are between frames the
    easier it is for the model to predict.
  </p>

  <video width="700" controls class="img_responsive">
    <source src="attachment/smallest.mp4" , type="video/mp4" />
  </video>

  <p>
    For comparison, below is the largest minute of driving data and it is 110
    KB. So in some sense this clip has 4 times more information than the
    previous clip and this is evident when you watch it. It is raining in the
    clip making predicting what will happen next very difficult as things pop in
    and out of frame constantly.
  </p>

  <video width="700" controls class="img_responsive">
    <source src="attachment/largest.mp4" , type="video/mp4" />
  </video>

  <p>
    We can also use these models to try and predict the future. If we feed them
    some driving video as context we can sample tokens into the future
    autoregressively and continue the video clip. For the clip below the first
    10 seconds is the context and then the next 10 seconds is predicted by the 9
    million parameter model.
  </p>

  <video width="700" controls class="img_responsive">
    <source src="attachment/9437184.mp4" , type="video/mp4" />
  </video>

  <p>
    The prediction is surprisingly coherent and the general features like the
    sky and road remain mostly consistent until the end. In contrast this clip
    below is the next 10 seconds as predicted by a 0.2 million parameter model.
  </p>

  <video width="700" controls class="img_responsive">
    <source src="attachment/196608.mp4" , type="video/mp4" />
  </video>

  <p>
    It very quickly diverges after the 10 second mark until it is not even
    recognizable as the original clip. The scene changes between night and day
    and various random things appear to pop into the frame randomly. This is a
    very nice visual way to see the differences between the two models and gives
    some intuition about how predicting what will happen next better also leads
    to better compression.
  </p>

  <h2>final remarks</h2>
  <p>
    Obviously there is still room for improvement here, in both compression
    ratio and the speed of decoding. You could quantize the model to 8 or 4 bits
    or do weight tying between the encoder and decoder or not even store a model
    at all and learn it as you decode.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think this last one is the most promising for getting very high
    compression ratios. Since you don't have to send a model you can make it as
    large as you want and larger models are more sample efficient so the
    compression ratio will improve the larger you make it even when training on
    the same data. The only problem here is of course speed because you have to
    retrain the model from scratch every single time you want to compress or
    decompress the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most obvious way to increase the decompression speed is to use multiple
    GPUs. Running 4 GPUs decoding sequences in parallel would make decompression
    4 times faster and even more would probably bring the compression times into
    the practical range.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally I would like to thank Comma for putting on this challenge, it was
    very fun!
