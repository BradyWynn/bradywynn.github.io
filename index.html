    Over the summer Neuralink held a
    <a href="https://content.neuralink.com/compression-challenge/README.html"
      >compression challenge</a
    >
    where 200x lossless compression was needed to send electrode recordings
    wirelessly. This was
    <a href="https://x.com/felix_red_panda/status/1794027648257020292"
      >mocked</a
    >
    as being impossible but inspired a similar challenge from
    <a href="https://comma.ai/">comma.ai</a>, a company developing an open
    source autopilot. This blogpost explains my submission to the comma challenge that
    is comparable to second place.
  </p>
  <h2>the challenge</h2>

    The challenge is to "losslessly compress 5,000 minutes of driving data." An
    example video of driving is shown below. (This video isn't actually from the data provided)
  </p>

      ,
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
  <br />
  <p>
    The video is low
    resolution, just 256x128. Since the full 5,000 minutes of footage would be very large, the data has been heavily compressed using
    a
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00937">VQ-VAE</a> to make it easier to handle.
  </p>
  <img src="attachment\image2274.png" class="img_responsive" width="700" />
  <p>
    Using the VQ-VAE network the video is compressed from raw 256x128 frames to
    10 bit 16x8 frames. This intermediate frame is called the latent
    representation and it being 10 bit means its values can take on any
    integer from 0 to 1023. If we only store the latent representation and
    decoder we can recover the original image. Note however that this is lossy
    compression which means information is lost when compressing. Below is the
    same example video but now compressed with the VQ-VAE.

      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
  <br />
  <p>
    Since each frame is compressed independently, there is temporal artifacting
    between them, but it captures the general features of the image. What is interesting
    is that we can find features in the latent representation directly.
    Below is the average of all the latent frames, with a visible horizon
    and road lines despite the low resolution.

    Before compression the data is about 915 mb, while the first place submission
    is about 270 mb, which gives a compression ratio of 3.4.
  </p>
  <h2>arithmetic coding</h2>
  <p>
    Arithmetic coding is a popular lossless compression technique. Lossless compression
    means that no information is lost in the process and is different from lossy
    compression formats such as jpeg that lose quality when compressed. To begin,
    arithmetic coding first needs a model that assigns a probability to each
    character of how likely it is to appear. An example is shown below:
  </p>
  <br />
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Character</th>
      <th>Probability</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>a</th>
      <th>0.2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>b</th>
      <th>0.3</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>c</th>
      <th>0.5</th>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br />
  <p>
    We also need a message to compress and in this case we will use
    "bac". To begin encoding the message we split the range from 0 to 1 into
    three different parts corresponding to the characters, with each interval's width
    dependent on its probability. Since the model assigns the highest
    probability to "c", it has the largest interval, while "a" and "b" have smaller
    intervals. The first letter of the message is "b", so the message has to be
    contained within the interval from 0.2 to 0.5. Since we know that the
    message has to be in that interval we can again subdivide it according to
    our characters and their probabilities. The second letter is "a" so the
    message must be contained within the new "a" interval, and we then further subdivide it
    into the three parts. We continue like this until the message has been fully
    encoded. The final interval that our message falls in is from 0.23 to 0.26
    because, for every single point inside the interval, the first three letters
    of the message are "bac".
  </p>
  <img src="attachment\encode 2.png" class="img_responsive" , width="700" />
  <p>
    However, we haven't actually compressed the message yet. We now need to
    convert this range into a binary sequence that can be stored. To do this we
    will split the interval from 0 to 1 in half; if the interval of our
    message falls below 0.5 we record a 0, and if it falls above 0.5, we record a 1. For our example, since
    the interval 0.23 to 0.26 is below 0.5, we record a 0 and split the range
    from 0 to 0.5 in half. We repeat this until the binary sequence is
    entirely contained within the interval of 0.23 to 0.26. For the message
    "bac" the encoding is 001111.
  </p>

  <img src="attachment\binary.png" class="img_responsive" , width="700" />
  <p>
    To decode the encoded message, you simply do the reverse of the encoding. First,
    convert the binary 001111 to decimal to get 0.234375. Since this falls
    within the range of 0.2 to 0.5 the first letter is "b". This is repeated until the message is recovered. However,
    you also need an end condition, because you could continue decoding a message
    forever. You can either define a specific character in the vocabulary to be
    an end-of-sequence character or simply stop at a specific length.
  </p>
  <p>
    What was described above is called infinite precision arithmetic coding
    because it requires infinite precision. Computers do not have
    infinite precision and if you were to try and implement this it would fail
    for longer sequences because the intervals would become so tiny that the
    computer would not be able to represent them properly.

      >This</a
    >
    excellent blog post explains the finite precision version of the algorithm
    that works for longer sequences and that I used for my implementation.
  </p>
  <h2>the model</h2>
  <p>
    As previously mentioned for arithmetic coding to work you need a model to
    provide probabilities for each symbol. Conveniently included in the
    repository with the driving data is a GPT-2 medium sized model (about 350 million
    parameters) that is trained on 3 million minutes of driving data to predict
    the next token. What they did was flatten the 10-bit 16x8
    latent representation into 128 "tokens" and the model takes in a fixed
    content length of the past n tokens, produing a probability distribution
    across all 1024 possible values for the next token.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can plug this model directly into arithmetic coding and
    use its probabilities to compress the data, and while it works, there are two
    major problems. The first problem that the model itself takes up 614 mb, so
    storing the model would take twice the space of the first place
    submission. The second problem is that because the model is so
    large, it is extremely slow. On my GPU (RTX 3070 Ti) it runs at 130 tokens
    per second which doesn't sound terrible, but since there
    are 768 million tokens (5,000 minutes * 1,200 frames per minute * 128 tokens per frame) it would take 68 days.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an aside, this isn't actually a novel idea, and
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10668">this</a> paper proposed exactly
    this method but with language models and text compression instead of driving
    data.
  </p>
  <h2>baseline model</h2>
  <p>
    At this point it is clear we are going to have to train our own model. It
    will almost certainly be worse than the one comma trained but if there
    is any hope of achieving a good compression ratio with fast speeds, it needs
    to be done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alongside the 5,000 minutes of driving data we need to compress, there is
    another 95,000 minutes of driving data we can use for training. The first
    baseline model has around 3.7 million parameters and is trained for 1 epoch.
    Most of the training details are unimportant, but
    shuffling the data and using 
    <a href="https://github.com/KellerJordan/Muon">Muon</a> instead of AdamW were the two most significant
    improvements. Below is the loss graph and the final loss is about 2.5.
  </p>

  />

  <p>
    The cool thing about cross entropy is that you can use the loss to estimate
    how well it will compress. The cross entropy implementation in pytorch uses
    natural log, but if we convert it to base 2 we get that the model needs about
    3.6 bits per symbol. Since each symbol normally takes 10 bits we can do
    10/3.6 to get a compression ratio of 2.78. This is already better than
    the second place submission! It's not quite right though because we also
    need to store the model which is about 7 mb so the actual compression ratio
    will be closer to 2.7.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the size of the model is no longer an issue it is still
    painfully slow. It generates at 908 tokens per second which is
    a definite an improvement, but it would still take 10 days to decompress all the
    data.
  </p>

  <h2>architecture improvements</h2>
  <p>
    If speed is an issue, we can always just train a smaller model; however, the
    performance drops as it gets smaller. Instead of shrinking the model we can
    change what it's predicting.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is currently predicting one token at a time. So to decode an entire 128
    token frame, the model needs to be run 128 times. This is because it's an
    autoregressive process so the previously generated tokens are passed into
    the context window of the model when it generates the next token.
    What if instead of predicting one token at a time we predict one frame at
    a time? We can make an independence assumption that tokens within a frame
    won't meaningfully help predict other tokens within the same frame, just the
    previous frames are good enough. With this assumption, we can modify the
    transformer to instead produce probabilities for every single token in a
    frame at the same time. This is a great idea because it
    means the model is 128 times faster for free.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another advantage of predicting on a frame level actually comes from an
    implementation detail with the original model. Since the frames are
    flattened down into 128 tokens, feeding a frame sequence into
    the model would prevent it from distinguishing where a frame begins or ends. To fix
    this, an extra token is added to the vocabulary called the BOS, or "Beginning
    of Sequence" token, and it's used to separate frames. The problem with this,
    however, is that now all the frames are 129 tokens instead of the original
    128. This is not ideal if you're trying to compress the data because the
    sequences are now longer. However,` with the modified frame level transformer we can
    get rid of the BOS token completely and instead add another positional
    embedding for frame position.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a sanity check that this independence assumption is
    reasonable, we can compare the loss graphs of the two models. While this is
    not an exact apples to apples comparison because of the differing vocabulary
    sizes (1024 vs 1025), it should be close enough.
  </p>

  />

  <p>
    The models eventually converge to about the same loss so this seems to
    validate the independence assumption. The great thing about this is that the
    new model can now generate at a blazingly fast 116,224 tokens per second.
    This means that to decode all 5,000 minutes of driving data it would take
    only 2 hours!
  </p>

  <h2>model size</h2>
  <p>
    So far the size of the baseline model was chosen arbitrarily but it has a major
    impact on the compression ratio. A larger model has a lower loss and can therefore
    compress better but the model itself takes up more space. Conversely a smaller model
    takes up less space but compresses worse. There is some optimal model size where the 
    tradeoffs are correctly balanced to achieve the maximum compression ratio.
